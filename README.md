# Campus Quest - CTP-Hackathon-2024
Hello! Welcome to Campus Quest. This project aims to solve ths issue that CUNY students are not aware of the different resources available to them at their campuses, and even if they know these resources are available they don't know where to locate them. We aim to fix this issue by game-ifying this problem. We at Campus Quest have developed a solution that motivates students to know where these resources are and when they're available by implementing Quests. We provide multiple choice questions that test a student's knowledge of these resources and rewards them based on their knowledge. We have a global leaderboard that tracks the highest scores, motivating students to try and aim for a better score. We also implemented an ai assistant QuickCalm to provide real-time feedback.
